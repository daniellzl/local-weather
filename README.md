# Local Weather

Displays weather conditions based on browser location.

[Live Application](local-weather-dlzl.surge.sh)

### Project Goals

Application was completed as a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather).

1. User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

2. User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

3. User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

4. Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.
